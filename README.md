# Cproj_01_max_area_of_Islands

With an m x n binary matrix grid, 
a group of blocks with a value 1 (connected 4-directionally, horizontal or vertical) represents an island.
other blocks with a value 0 will be taken as sea (not area of island).

The area of an island is the number of cells with the goup of blocks with value 1.

Task:
Try to find the maximum area of an island in grid. 
(Ans is 0, as no island is found in grid)

Solutions:
- C++
- OOP (not essential for solving this problem)
- recursion

Constraints:
m, n are integers larger than 1.
1 <= m, n < 50
With the provided grid, only either 0 or 1 is allowed.
