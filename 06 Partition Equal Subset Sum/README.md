# 06 Partition Equal Subset Sum

(To be updated)

A binary tree with values on every nodes and an integer are given.

A root is a the first node in the tree, and a leaf is a node with no children.

- Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
- Output: Yes, this array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.
- Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Task:
- allow user to input a integer (larger than 0) as n.
- generate a series of strings, each contains n valid parentheses but with different order.
- if not, request user to input integer, trying to find a way

Solutions:
- C++
- dynamic programming
- 0/1 knapsack
- memoization
- unique set

Time complexity: O()
- for 
- n as the number of parentheses generated in a string

Space complexity: O(4^n / n^0.5)

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
